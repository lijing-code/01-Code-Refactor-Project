# <01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor>

## Description

This is my very first HTML & CSS and Git project in GeorgiaTech Bootcamp. It is a refactoring project that I need to change the existing code in HTML and CSS to improve the web accessibility for Horiseon. The Horiseon webpage includes a header image, navigation bar, three sections for describing their business, and three sections for describing their business benefits, and a footer. Most of the content in HTML are not well-organized, and their CSS has many repetition parts because of the confusion of the class defined in HTML. My goals are improving the readability of HTML and the efficiency of CSS by consolidating the elements, class, and attributes followed semantic structure including comments for every changes. 

What I did in this project:
√ Change HTML elements in semantic structure.
√ Make HTML elements follow logical structure with independent of styling and positioning in CSS.
√ Combine the repetition content in CSS and change CSS element order based on HTML.
√ Change the heading attributes order.
√ Change the title more detailed.
√ Delete repetitive classes and elements.
√ Add comments on what I did to refactor the code.
√ Create project and deploy it to GitHub.

What I learned after finishing the project is the importance of logical and rational coding for web development and maintenance, and the importance of comment lines and README doc in code refactor.
